# Emotiv Lab Streaming Layer Interface
Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) is a protocol that enables streamlined and synchronized collection of time series measurements across multiple machines. The LSL feature is designed to support research experiments requiring sub-millisecond timing precision and to allow efficient, two-way communication between EmotivPRO and other third party software and devices. EmotivPROâ€™s LSL feature allows users to synchronize data streams across multiple devices and allows real- time processing of raw EEG data in 3rd party Apps. LSL also makes it possible to send distinct markers on different computing devices and synchronize markers across the devices.
Here are guidelines and some examples to use LSL with EMOTIV Brainwear&reg;.

## Prerequisites

* [Download and install](https://www.emotiv.com/developer/) the EMOTIV App and EmotivPRO.
* Get a EmotivPRO license from https://www.emotiv.com/emotivpro/

## How to work with LSL Outlet

### Configuration
After connecting your EMOTIV Brainwear&reg; headset on EmotivPro, go to Settings > LSL > Outlet as below:
<p align="center">

</p>

* **Stream name:** Set the stream name for transmission. The stream name consists of the prefix "EmotivDataStream-"  combined with data types such as: *EEG*, *Motion*, *Performance-Metrics*, *Contact-Quality* or *EEG-Quality*.

* **Data stream:** Choose the data stream for transmission and select between supported EEG, Motion, Performance Metrics, Contact Quality, EEG Quality Data. Each one will create an individual LSL stream.

* **Data format:** Currently, 2 types are supported: *cf_float32* or *cf_double64*. But if you choose type *cf_float32*, the timestamp might not be correct as expected because the timestamp value is out of range(-16777216 to 16777216) which mentioned in [LSL doc](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/projects/liblsl/ref/enums.html).

* **Transmit type:** Set the transmission type by selecting between *Sample* or *Chunk*. For Chunk, you can set the Chunk size to be 4/16/32/64/128/256.

### Data Output format
The data output format as below table:

Stream type | Data output format | Sample rate | Channels details
----------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------
EEG | {"Timestamp", "Counter", "Interpolate", <EEG sensors>, "HardwareMarker" } | 128Hz/ 256 Hz | [EEG Channel details ](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/data-subscription/data-sample-object#eeg)
Motion | {"Timestamp", "Counter", "Interpolate", "Q0","Q1","Q2","Q3", "ACCX","ACCY","ACCZ", "MAGX","MAGY","MAGZ"} |32 Hz / 64 Hz / 128 Hz | [Motion Channel details ](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/data-subscription/data-sample-object#motion)
Performance-Metrics | {"Timestamp", "Engagement","Excitement","Focus","Interest ", "Relaxation","Stress"} | 2 Hz for high resolution / 0.1 Hz for low resolution | [Performance Channel details ](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/data-subscription/data-sample-object#performance-metric)
Contact-Quality | {"Timestamp", "BatteryPercent", "Overall", "Signal", <EEG sensors> } | 2 Hz | [CQ Channel details ](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/data-subscription/data-sample-object#device-information)
EEG-Quality | {"Timestamp","BatteryPercent","Overall","SampleRateQuality", <EEG sensors>} | 2 Hz | [EQ Channel details ](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/data-subscription/data-sample-object#eeg-quality)


## How to work with LSL Inlet

### Configuration
After connecting your EMOTIV Brainwear&reg; headset on EmotivPro, go to Settings > LSL > Inlet as below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Emotiv/labstreaminglayer/blob/emotiv-lsl/docs/images/config-inlet.png">
</p>

After sending marker via LSL, You can see the stream name in the Inlet page. Choose one then click the Connect button. After that, you will see the marker being added to the data stream as below:

  <img src="https://github.com/Emotiv/labstreaminglayer/blob/emotiv-lsl/docs/images/marker-added.png">
</p>

### Data Input format

Currently we only support sending markers to the Inlet with 2 options:

1. A simple marker value - Double / integer type is expected but EmotivPRO will extract only the integer part before adding into data stream.
  * Expected format of data: `{"MarkerValue"}`

2. Marker with time for timing synchronization - The marker event is a vector with 3 elements:
  * `MarkerTime` is the epoch time of the event in double type.
  * `MarkerValue` is value of marker. Double / integer type is expected but EmotivPRO will extract only the integer part before adding into data stream.
  * `CurrentTime` is current epoch time (double type) when the marker is being pushed to the Inlet. It is usually later than the `MarkerTime`.
  * Expected format of data: `{"MarkerTime", "MarkerValue", "CurrentTime"}`
